## What is Typescript?
- TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed like C# or Java.

### Difference between TypeScript and JavaScript:
- TypeScript is known as an Object-oriented programming language whereas JavaScript is a scripting language.
- TypeScript always points out the compilation errors at the time of development only. Because of this in the run-time, the chance of getting errors is very less whereas JavaScript is an interpreted language.
- TypeScript has a feature that is strongly typed or supports static typing. That means Static typing allows for checking type correctness at compile time. This is not available in JavaScript.
- TypeScript is nothing but JavaScript and some additional features i.e. ES6 features. It may not be supported in your target browser but the TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts files into ES3, ES4, and ES5 also.

### Setup
- ``` npm init ```
- ``` npm i typescript --save-dev ```
- ``` npx tsc --init ```
- > "outDir": "dist" 
- ``` git init ```
